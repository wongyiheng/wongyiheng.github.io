    <h1>Wong Yi Heng</h1>
    <h3>If there's a will, there's a way!</h3>
    <p>I'm the pro, pro procrastinator, but nothing can drag me down (kind of). There's time for fun, there's time for
        headache (which is now- literally) Despite of that, my name always remind me to have determination and have a
        goal. Perhaps a dream of mine is to be a comic/ manga artist or a storyteller that share the joy of interesting
        story to others which sets my vision. But, maybe I could cooperate media skills innit as well who knows? Steady
        lah, fear not~ time management is still the thing for me to learn.A saying goes, "If there's a will, there's a
        way", ofc, I'll remember you if somehow I get popular someday.</p>
